# day 1
Started building an IMDB scraper and making a prototype site. Important decision was to limit the data to the top 250 IMDB movies, since those are the most relevant and it also takes a lot of time to scrape data. At last limiting to top 250 improves the capability to compare data point and therefore improves the storytelling

# day 2
Finished scraper for the most important part and parse it to a json file. Most important change was to scrape all movies instead of just one to test whether it works. Hence an extra script was needed that provides me with the movie id's. Those are used to iterate over all movies to scrape them when iterating. 
For now the json file contains: Title, Year, Score, Genres and related movies. Later on extra data could be added. But for now this will be a good start.
Started linking the search box to the data
Imported decision was to change one graph to a scatterplot, hence it will provide an overview where the selected data can ben compared with the other top 250 movies. So instead of two graphs providing info about the selected movies, one graph will be changed and provide informatie about the selected movie compared to the other movies. This therefore will be a scatter plot.

# day 3
Decoded movie titles to titles without accents. This took a lot of effort, but a python package made a lot of help. Also a major problem was a non-breaking space unicode character at the end. This is now fixed by first encoding all the unicde characters to the most similar ascii (without accents). After that the nbsp could easily be deleted.
Improved the connection between the search box and the data. Now information was provided that was relevant for the movie that was filled in. For instance the year of the movie.

# day 4
Added a scatter plot with year and score of the movie. Hence some data changes had to be made, so some new data structures were initialized in javascript. For now I'll keep my json format the same, since this provides a good overview for now. It is an object of movie titles, that contains an object with al the relevant information for each movie.
Also interactivity is added, it provides the user with the title, year and score.
After that a link was build between the search bar and the scatter plot. The user is able to search for a movie. When the search icon is clicked the dot corresponding to the movie wil make a transition to another color and a bigger dot. For now the color is red, but this is likely to be changed in the future.
At last autocomplete/suggestions for the search bar are added. 

# day 5
Added a node graph. At first a graph was added with just a data example to see how the graph works when chanegs in the data are made. After that the task was to implement our data to the graph. The idea for now was to make a graph with in the middle the current (chosen) movie that is linked to the other related movies. The color represents the total links of the linked movies with the other linked movies. The color scale has to be improved. It was a big job to retrieve the data, since you have to find the data of related movies form the current movie. After that you have to check of these related movies have connections to the other related movies, it took a lot of time to program that. It is now managed by another python script that adds the correct dictionary to the movies dictionary, such that that data dictionary can be used for the node graph. The first idea was to check if the related movies of the current movies are linked to each other, that also took a lot of time. But when the answers were known almost every movie was linked. I was afraid that those links would make the graph a mess. So that is skipped for now, but might be implemented in the future. I will now stuck to this version and maybe improve it in the future. After that interactivity is added to see information about the related movies. Also when a dot is clicked the scatter and the node graph update to that movie.
Scatter is updated on click. If the user clicks on a dot information about the corresponding movie will be shown, so the dot color in the scatter plot will change and also the node graph updated to that movie. So there is interactivity between the two graphs. Also the ald dot on the scatter removes. And some other minor issues were fixed. At last I did some research to update the node graph, but this was hard since it makes use of force. Update functions are hard to use with this function. For now the parts that draw the nodes are initialized again. All the svg elements etc remain the same

# day 6

Today the barchart was added. It has an update function. All graphs are linked. Click on scatter or node graph updates all three graphs. Typing a movie in the search box does the same. For the barchart some cleaning had to be done, that took more work than expected. It was hard to find the problem, but it's fixed for now in javascript. Maybe change it in the future in the python file that provides the json file, such that no cleaning is needed anymore. Also the interactivity is improved, at first interactivity elements for all graphs were elements of the div/svg of the first graph. This is changed now, resulting in a huge change of the tooltip position. The problem with that position is also fixed. At last a problem with the nodegraph was spotted. It doesn't update the colors from the graph, this is probably caused by the fact that the dots aren't selected. It took some time to try to debug that, but it isn't solved yet. This problem has to be solved later.

# day 7
Relationshipgraph is fixed on update. The nodes are now correctly updated, also the hover over is working as it should work. Javascript file cleaned by making sure that in every line correct indentation is used. There is still a problem with for example 'Logan'in the node graph. I have found out what the problem is. For example logan has related movies that aren't in the top 250 movies, so javascript is not possible to retrieve their information from the json file. I have made a start to parse the data that is used for the nodegraph correctly, but it doesn't behave as expected for now. The graph is messed up, but I will fix that as mentioned by modifying the scrape script and parse the data to the json correctly. Also the nodegraph is improved since some lines were drawn multiple times, this was also a mistake in the script that provides the data. This is fixed now.
